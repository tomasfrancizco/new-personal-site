This is the first of multiple articles i’m going to write in which i’ll analyse, explain and solve some CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges of the Ethereum ecosystem. These are exercises in which one must find and exploit one or several vulnerabilities in (in this case) Smart Contracts.

There are a bunch of sites for this but the most famous and the ones I’ll try are Capture The Ether, Damn Vulnerable Defi and The Ethernaut.

I encourage you to first try and solve them yourself, but if you get really stuck or want to see what I’ve learnt after doing them, you’re welcome to stop by.

In this article I’ll start with the basic setup you need to complete the Capture The Ether’s challenges.

First of all you’ll want to install Metamask in your browser. Metamask is a browser based crypto wallet used to interact with the Ethereum networks. If you are using Chrome or Brave you can look for it at the Chrome Web Store and add it as an extension.

After registering as a user, second step is changing your network to Ropsten as that’s the one Capture The Ether runs on. Ropsten network is a testnet (used for testing things as the ether there, known as rETH, has no real value) and the most similar to the mainnet as it relies on proof of work as a consensus mechanism, too. There are other testnets but as far as I know, all of them rely on proof of authority, which makes things a little bit different.

You can change networks by clicking on “Ethereum Mainnet” at the top of your Metamask UI and selecting the one you need.

After this, you’ll have to get some rETH to be able to send transactions across the network. You can do so by requesting them to a “faucet”. Faucets are basically web sites that give away testnet ether so people can use them as they wish. Let me warn you that most of them usually don’t work very well, so this may be the first problem you encounter. Other ways of getting testnet ether are asking people to send you some (you may try on reddit, discord or other crypto forums) or you can try mining them yourself. For this, there are some tutorials online but I need to warn you that it’s not an easy task, although a very interesting one if you have a lot of thirst for knowledge.

To access the faucet, click on “buy” under the amount of ETH in your account, then on “get ether” and follow the instructions. When asked for your address you can copy it by clicking where it says “0x…” just under “Ropsten Test Network”. If that one doesn’t work you can google other faucets and try your luck. With a bit more than 1 rETH, you’ll be fine to go.

That’s it, now you’re ready to start solving the challenges. In the next article I’m going to dive deep into the warmup exercises.

This is a never-ending path of learning, so if you have any comment or correction, please leave it in the comments below and I’ll be more than happy to discuss it.
